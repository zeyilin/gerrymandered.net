<h1 id="toc_0">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2 id="toc_1">What is gerrymandering?</h2>

<p>Every 10 years, after the United States Census Bureau releases the national census, Congressional voting districts in
    the United States are redrawn by state legislators and governors; Congress has the right to regulate and modify
    these state plans.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Put simply, gerrymandering occurs when these political boundaries are redrawn to give one political party a numeric
    advantage over another. Of interest is the etymology of the term--&quot;gerrymandering&quot; comes from former
    Governor Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, who in 1810 redistricted a congressional district in the state in the
    shape of a salamander; hence, the portmanteau &quot;gerry-mander.&quot;<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2"
                                                                                               rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>For an educational look at the process of gerrymander, check out this excellent <a
        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/01/this-is-the-best-explanation-of-gerrymandering-you-will-ever-see/"><em>Washington
    Post</em></a> article, complete with visualizations, that explains gerrymandering.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">How does it affect me?</h2>

<p>Gerrymandering can significantly skew the electoral outcomes of Congressional races, which may be politically
    frustrating for individual voters. For example, if you reside in a state whose residents&#39; votes end up being a
    majority for a political party one way or another, yet Congressional redistricting yields the exact opposite
    political result. An example of this case is in North Carolina during the 2012 Congressional elections, in which its
    electorate voted Democratic by an extremely slight majority (50.5% versus 48.7%), yet ended up with more than twice
    the number of Republican members of Congress elected than Democratic ones.<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3"
                                                                                                  rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">What can I do about it?</h2>

<p>Recent anti-gerrymandering reform efforts have failed to gain much headway. However, there are several things that
    you can do to combat the problem of gerrymandering. Contact your state representative about your dissatistfaction if
    you so choose! Continue to embrace voter efficacy by casting your ballot in local, state, and national elections!
    And consider reading more about some alternatives to the current redistricting process, such as creating an
    independent commission to redraw districts instead of relying on state governments, or potentially transitioning to
    completely computer-aided voting district redrawing in the future.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4"
                                                                                          rel="footnote">4</a></sup>
    <sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6"
                                                                                   rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<h1 id="toc_5">Reflecting on Our Hackathon Experiences</h1>

<h2 id="toc_6">About The Site: Gerrymandered.net</h2>

<p>[Gerrymandered.net(Gerrymandered.net)] was created by Yash Aggarwal, Sami Glasco, and Zeyi Lin during the weekend of
    January 15 - 17, 2016, for the <a href="http://hack.rice.edu">2016 HackRice hackathon</a>. With the heated debates
    of the 2016 Presidential primary races already underway early in 2016, this website serves to underscore the
    continued importance of Congressional races even during Presidential election years.</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">What it does</h2>

<p>The website allows users to enter a location within the United States and territories to see in which Congressional
    districts they live and who their Members of Congress are. Users can submit parts of a full address, a zip code,
    geographical coordinates, or use the browser-based location tool to pass in an address.</p>

<p>Once a valid location in the 50 U.S. states or territories is entered, the user is greeted with the name and a map of
    his or her Congressional district. Below the map is more information about the lawmakers in each district, including
    the district representative in the House and the two state Senators. For citizens to engage, there are options
    to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>view these lawmakers&#39; voting records for bills, resolutions, nominations, or other measures</li>
    <li>visit their websites</li>
    <li>contact them over the phone</li>
    <li>send documents to them via fax</li>
    <li>provide consituent feedback directly online</li>
    <li>like them on Facebook</li>
    <li>follow them on Twitter</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there is an FAQ section to the site that explains the concept of gerrymandering and why it is
    electorally significant to the average voter. There is also a prompt to help build a broader base of eligible voters
    by linking to resources that help them to register to vote if they have not done so already.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">Challenges we ran into</h2>

<p>Gerrymandered.net was not our first idea; we originally thought of a broadband comparison tool that would scrape the
    websites of various Internet Service Providers and give the user the best &quot;bang-for-buck&quot; Internet deal.
    However, this idea was already in very mature fruition--just see some of the talented work done by the folks at <a
            href="http://broadbandnow.com/">http://broadbandnow.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Having scrapped our initial idea Saturday morning, the main challenge that our team encountered was the time crunch
    of finding a new idea. After a quick session of brainstorming, we were off to the races.</p>

<h2 id="toc_9">Accomplishments that we&#39;re proud of</h2>

<p>HackRice was our first hackathon! There were many new experiences for the whole team but above all we were thrilled
    to follow through with this commitment and see this project come to fruition.</p>

<p>In particular, for our first hackathon, we felt that we were able to iterate quickly and work together effectively.
    For example, being able to pick up the syntax of a new language like Python or explore new ways of using services
    like Heroku were fun learning opportunities that will prove invaluable in the future. For two of our group members,
    it was our first full stack website, and being able to transition between having a back-end and front-end role was
    fun.</p>

<p>Another accomplishment we were proud of was exploring the hackathon from a more civic-minded perspective. In today&#39;s
    day and age it is easy to drown out voices in heated political debate, so we thought that any little tool to help
    quell those passions and bring about objectivity and transparency could help.</p>

<h2 id="toc_10">What we learned</h2>

<p>We primarily learned the power of APIs. Without the availability of numerous datasets, such as the ones made
    accessible by using APIs provided by <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/developers/api">govtrack.us</a>, <a
            href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/">the Sunlight Foundation</a>, and <a
            href="http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/congress_api">the New York Times</a>, we would not have been
    able to easily access such rich historical data.</p>

<p>On the otherhand, we also learned that sometimes APIs may have their own issues--one of the API calls that we used
    returned some inconsistent data. We actually ended up making our first API <a
            href="https://github.com/sunlightlabs/congress/issues/517">issue report</a> this way.</p>

<h2 id="toc_11">What&#39;s next for Gerrymandered</h2>

<p>A few things are left to do for the site, and with some extra time and tweaking, we think they can happen:</p>

<ul>
    <li>a graphical interpretation or visualization of Member of Congress&#39; voting records over time</li>
    <li>state and local representative information</li>
    <li>exploration of other APIs, such as Google&#39;s Civic Information API--there&#39;s a whole new world out
        there!
    </li>
</ul>
